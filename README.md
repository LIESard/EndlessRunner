# Endless Runner

## Intro
This is a project I've been working on for about two-three months.

It's basically just a way for me to teach myself how to program video games.
I would say it's done the trick.

At the time of writing this game is in a playable state and it's also very late at night/early in the morning.
I'm not planning on adding anything else to it.
There's a class and a file for high scores but I haven't implemented that yet so those are pretty much just empty.
Right now, there are 10421 lines with 512 of them being actual code.

## Controls
Left Control to jump
When you reach 10 points, you can move left
When you reach 20 points, you can move left and right

## TODO
If I were to add any more functions, they would be:
- Highscore system with usernames and stuff
- An image that shows what keys to press in the game, so like a Ctrl key at the start of the game and stuff
- Better sprites
- SFX
- Not doing this at 2 in the morning
